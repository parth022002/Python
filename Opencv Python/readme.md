# OpenCV (Python)


Requirements:
1) Python
2) Opencv
3) caer

What I learned and appiled is as follows :\
Basics:
  1) Read Image
  2) Read Video
  3) Resize and Rescale Image
  4) Rsize and Rescale Video
  5) Draw and rewrite on Image
  6) Basics Essential Functions in opencv\
      Image convert\
      Blur Image\
      Edge Cascade\
      Dilating the image\
      Eording Image\
      Resizing the image\
      Cropping the Image
  7) Image Transformation\
      Image Transaction Shifting image\
      Image Rotation\
      Resizing\
      Flipping
  8) Contours
  9) Threshold in Image

Advance:
  1) Spaces/Switching between colour spaces:\
     BRG to gray code\
     BRG to HSV\
     BRG to L*A*b\
     BRG to RGB\
     HSV to RGB\
     HSV to BGR\
     LAB to BGR
  3) Splitting and merging colour channels
  4) Blurring Technique
  5) BITWISE operator
  6) Masking
  7) Histogram Computation
  8) Advanced Edge Detection

Face Detection & Recognition
  1) HaarCascade algorithm used to detect the face from the image
  2) Developed the deep learning mode to train and develop the model for the image recodnition of the image
